# Dream Bank

This program uses a programmer defined class with an output string variable.  We find that "canned" std:toString(double) method cannot be formatted.  This is needed because U.S. money doesn't use more than two places after the decimal.  IT is possible to use a stringstream header to accomplish this task but we weren't supposed to do that.
