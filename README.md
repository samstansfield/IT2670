C++ Programming

This course is an introduction to C++ programming.  I felt that I needed C++ to round out my knowledge of different languages.  It was not difficult, The best part about C++ is how close it is to machine code.  I am interested in large scale programs.  The main issue with Java in this regard is the need to rely on the virtual machine for executing programs.  This has the effect of slowing down processing.  Interpreted languages have a natural slow-down because of the interpreter.
