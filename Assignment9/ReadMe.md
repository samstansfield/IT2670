# Calculator

This program creates a simple calculator.  We had very specific instuctions about how to accomplish this.  It required creating an instance of the calculator class every time a calculation is performed.  This is not how I would have done it.  Making a new instance of the class every time wastes resources.  Better to instantiate the class once and use methods to accomplish the calculations.
