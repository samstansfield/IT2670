# Family Printer

This program has multiple classes. It also has an "include" file.  Because of the way we had to submit assignments it was not possible to submit multiple files so there were actually two versions, one with the include file and one without it.  Using an include file does make life a lot easier.  One can then just look at the include file to see the method signatures without wading through the code of all the methods.
